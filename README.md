# Sign language detection with Computer Vision

## Overview

This project is aimed at detecting American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets in real-time using computer vision. The system utilizes OpenCV for image processing, MediaPipe for hand detection, and a Random Forest classifier from scikit-learn for alphabet recognition.
